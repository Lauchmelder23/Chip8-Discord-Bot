# Chip8-Discord-Bot
I implemented a chip8 interpreter as discord bot. End my suffering

  It has neither sound nor keyboard input
  
  It has 1 FPS (due to discord's limitation on sending messages)
  
  The screen is cropped on the right and on the bottom by one row (also due to discord's limitation on sending messages
  
  Sometimes it traps itself in infinite loops and you can do nothing except restart him
  
  It does not contain every Chip8 opcode (yet)
  
  
## Commands:
?start [n]      -     Executes demo file *demo[n].ch8*
?break          -     Stops execution. Does not work consistently
